<p id="curbtoxic">Curbing Toxic Behavior</p>
<p id="textbox1">In any industry, especially in male-dominated industries, sexism exists. The world of video-gaming is no exception to this rule, but unlike other industries, modern video game culture remains medieval in its treatment of women and minorities. Scraptalk is an optional plugin for the streaming service Twitch designed to reduce toxicity and abusive speech within gaming streams. By encouraging gamers to limit and moniter their own toxic behavior and making inclusion into Scraptalked spaces optional, Scraptalk achieves this behavior change without riling the easily upset gaming community. Its mechanisms for change are rooted in psychology, and it carefully considers the entire gaming community in order to maximize inclusion.</p>

<p id="gamingCapital">Gaming capital refers to the intangible social assets that enable competitive video gaming environments to function smoothly. As a hybrid of in-game peer pressure and the drive to maintain a reputation of skill, trash talking other players is often considered gaming capital and is thus even integral to the gaming experience. Occasionally, however, trash talk goes further than friendly jibes and banter; gaming toxicity refers to the intentional harassment and abuse of other players within a video game environment. “According to Ditch the Label, an anti-bullying organization
    and partner of gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA), nearly 60 percent of players have been bullied in an online game whether for being female, black, gay or simply
    for showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time” </p>

<p id="freedomOfSpeech">Freedom of speech is an important part of one’s experience playing video games, so it is crucial that streamers choose if and when Scraptalk is enabled on their streams. When Scraptalk is active, potential viewers of that stream must consent to Scraptalk’s terms or simply watch another stream. Scraptalk operates on a 3-strike basis. On a third offense, the offender is banned from all streams that have Scraptalk enabled. Sorry trolls, hate has no place here!</p>

<div id="scraptalkWorks">What Makes Scraptalk Work</div>
<div id="gamerOptions">Giving Gamers Options</div>
<div id="ih8freedom">The biggest challenge I faced in designing Scraptalk was working with the “freedom of speech” value held by competitive gaming culture (and American culture) at large. Many toxic users equate “freedom of speech” to “freedom of hate speech,” and it is this behavior in particular that Scraptalk targets and attempts to change. It is vital that users feel as if their hate speech is not being censored, so allowing users the option to send their message anyway is critical. The ideal action a user would take is to simply scap the message entirely, but users are also allowed to retype their message without toxicity. The aim of Scraptalk is not to censor all hate speech but rather to encourage users to practice “sensibility of speech” alongside “freedom of speech.”</div>

<div id="umpteenthWhiteBox"></div>
<div id="umpteenthWhiteBoxText">If a user chooses to send their abusive message in spite of being warned, Scraptalk adds a strike to that user’s profile and informs the sender of the toxicity in their flagged message. </div>
<div id="unsentAngryLetter">The Unsent Angry Letter</div>
<div id="gamingToxicity">The prevalence of gaming toxicity is no accident. When early game consoles first hit the market, video games were marketed as an outlet for frustrated people to vent their anger. Mix this with anonymous handles and a lack of accountability and you have a whole lot of toxic trash talk on your hands. Scraptalk does not discount the theraputic qualities venting in gaming allows, but research shows that the relief felt by such behavior occurs not in the sending of the message, but rather in the typing. Thus, like an angry letter you decide not to mail, not all trash talk should reach its intended audience.</div>

<div id="colorPsych">Color Psychology: Priming</div>
<div id="colorPsychText">In Western Culture, the color red
    has been linked to error avoidance while the color blue
    has been  linked to creative thinking. By priming the text I needed users to associate with errors in red— and the text I needed users
    to think creatively about in blue,
    I am able to subtly influence the
    behaviors of gamers without
    stepping on the toes of “freedom
    of speech,” an issue many gamers
    feel particularly strongly about. Yellow is frequently used to denote interactions or options for further inquiry within a game (i.e. a quest) and we use it sparingly to encourage users to interact with Scraptalk. Versions of Scraptalk marketed to other cultures may have to edit its color scheme.</div>
